                    This page might <span className="red">feel slow</span> at first,
                    because it is also eagerly loading and mounting the 3d plot behind the
                    scenes! You can actually already navigate to any of the links below
                    right now (which I recommend), even if this page hasn't fully loaded
                    yet.
