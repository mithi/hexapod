Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 
All types of contributions are welcome, no matter how big or small.

## Useful things:
- Before contributing, please discuss the change you wish to make in an issue before making this change. 
- I use a automated code formatters ([prettier][prettier_link] for Javascript, [black][black_link] for Python for example) to format my code.
- I use [code climate][code_climate_link] to check for code smells.
- Please read [the commit style guide][commit_style_guide_link], the guide which I try to adhere to when wording my commit messages. These are not rules, just a guide.
- I prefer PRs with fewer commits. Squash the commits and push force if you need to. But of course, it's better if all the changes in one commit are logically connected. Thoughtfully-written explanations and the rationale of the pull request is always appreciated. Here's [a simple git workflow](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod/wiki/Simple-Git-Workflow-guide) I try to stick to. 
- And of course, Don't be mean :) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
