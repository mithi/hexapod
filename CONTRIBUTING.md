Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! 
All types of contributions are welcome, no matter how big or small.

## Useful things:

- Before contributing, please discuss the change you wish to make in an issue before making this change. Explain what you want to accomplish (e.g the problem you want to solve), why you want to do it, and how would do it. Wait for it to get assigned to you!
- First-time contributors are welcome! If you need clarification, don't hesitate to ask! There are no stupid questions! Your PR will not be merged if the CI build fails.
- Consistent code formatting is important. I use automated code formatters ([prettier][prettier_link] for Javascript, [black][black_link] for Python for example) to format my code.
- I use [code climate][code_climate_link] to check for code smells.
- Please read [the commit style guide][commit_style_guide_link], the guide which I try to adhere to when wording my commit messages. These are not rules, just a guide.
- I prefer PRs with fewer commits. [Squash the commits and push force][rewriting_git_history_link] if you need to. But of course, it's better if all the changes in one commit are logically connected. For whatever purpose it may serve, here's [a simple git workflow][git_workflow_link] I try to stick to. Adding appropriate tests in your PR is always appreciated.
- Thoughtfully-written explanations and the rationale of the pull request is required! Explain what your PR is solving, why, and how. [Allow project maintainers to edit your pull request][how_to_allow_pr_edits_link].
- Of course, Be a nice person :) [![Contributor Covenant][contributor_covenant_badge]](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
